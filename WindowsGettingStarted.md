Download and install the things:

- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win): allows you to locally make changes to the site and apply the changes the shared repository
- [Github Windows client](https://windows.github.com/): allows you to avoid using the scary command line
- *optional* [atom](https://atom.io/): simple developer centered text editor

The default settings are recommended when installing all of the above.

Log into github in the windows client

Clone the repository.  Pay attention to the directory it is copied to.  By default it seems to put it in `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\GitHub`
