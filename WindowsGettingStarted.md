Download and install the things:

- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win): allows you to locally make changes to the site and apply the changes the shared repository
- [Github Windows client](https://windows.github.com/): allows you to avoid using the scary command line
- *optional* [atom](https://atom.io/): simple developer centered text editor

The default settings are recommended when installing all of the above.

Log into github in the windows client

Clone the repository.  Pay attention to the directory it is copied to.  By default it seems to put it in `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\GitHub`

Open the folder in atom (or your favorite text editor)

Start making changes and adding files.

When you are done, navigate to the Windows Github Client.  Click the down arrow next to uncommitted changes

Here, review the changes and check all changes you would like to "push to remote" or see on our shared site (1).  When you are happy, write a short description of the changes you made (2).  Then commit the changes (3).

Next "push" or sync your changes by pressing the sync button in the upper right corner.
