For those uninitiated into developer-type things, here lies some guidence on how to get started editing these pages.

# Download and Install the Things:

- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win): allows you to locally make changes to the site and apply the changes the shared repository
- [Github Windows client](https://windows.github.com/): allows you to avoid using the scary command line
- *optional* [atom](https://atom.io/): simple developer centered text editor

The default settings are recommended when installing all of the above.

# Get and Edit the Things

## 1. Log In.
Log into github in the windows client

## 2. Clone the repository.  
Pay attention to the directory it is copied to.  By default it seems to put it in `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\GitHub`

## 3. Open the folder
Either in atom or your favorite text editor

## 4. Start making changes and adding files.

## 5. Save it remotely!
When you are done, navigate to the Windows Github Client.  Click the down arrow next to uncommitted changes

Here, review the changes and check all changes you would like to "push to remote" or see on our shared site (1).  When you are happy, write a short description of the changes you made (2).  Then commit the changes (3).
